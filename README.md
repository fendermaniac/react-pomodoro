# React Pomodoro Timer

## Introduction

This is a basic pomodoro timer build in React.  If you have not heard about the Pomodoro Technique it is a time management method that breaks work down into intervals separated by short breaks.  You can read more about it on it's Wikipedia page here [Pomodro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

### Usage

By default the Pomodoro App will have a 25 minute work interval and a 5 minute break interval.  Both can be adjusted.  You can also reset the application to restart your session.  

#### Roadmap

- Track how many sessions have been completed.
- Convert State Management to Redux
- Add Unit Tests
